# SecureAuth - Future Development Plan

> **Note:** Before implementing these changes, migrate API to MockAPI.com

Google OAuth

---

## 1. Strengthen Authentication Logic (Frontend + API)

### 1.1 Token-Based Authentication ✅

**Current Issue:** Only storing `userID` in localStorage

**Implementation Steps:**

- Generate a fake token (UUID or random string) after successful login
- Store token in `localStorage`
- Attach token in headers for every API request
- Validate token in route loaders

**Benefit:** Makes the project closer to real-world authentication systems

---

### 1.2 Auto Logout on Session Expiry ✅

**Implementation Steps:**

- Store login timestamp in `localStorage`
- Set session timeout (e.g., 30 minutes)
- Check session validity on route navigation
- Auto logout if session expired
- Display "Session Expired" toast notification

**Benefit:** Simulates production-grade session management

---

### 1.3 Prevent Manual localStorage Tampering ✅

**Current Security Flaw:** Users can manually change ID in localStorage to access other accounts

**Fix Strategy:**

1. On every protected route, fetch user data by ID from API
2. Cross-check email or token with stored values
3. If mismatch detected → force logout
4. Clear localStorage and redirect to login

**Benefit:** Removes major security vulnerability

---

## 2. Role-Based Access Control System

### User Schema Enhancement

Add `role` field to user object:

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "name": "Pranav",
  "email": "admin@gmail.com",
  "password": "123",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

### Features to Implement

- **Admin Dashboard**
  - View all users
  - Delete users
  - Block/unblock users
  - View system statistics

- **User Dashboard**
  - Limited access to personal data only
  - Cannot access admin features

- **Role-Based Route Protection**
  - Protect admin routes from regular users
  - Redirect unauthorized access attempts

**Benefit:** Elevates project to enterprise-level architecture

---

## 3. User Management Features

### 3.1 Account Deactivation ✅

**Implementation:**

- Add `isActive: true` field to user schema
- Check `isActive` status during login
- If `false` → block login with appropriate message

---

### 3.2 Change Password ✅

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Verify old password matches current password
2. Validate new password (strength requirements)
3. Update password via API
4. Show success confirmation

---

### 3.3 Forgot Password Simulation ✅

**Flow:**

1. User enters email address
2. Check if email exists in database
3. If exists → show password reset screen
4. Allow user to set new password
5. Update password via API

**Note:** No real email sending required - just simulate the flow

---

## 4. Advanced Profile Features

### Additional User Fields

Add the following fields to enhance user profiles:

- **Profile Picture:** Store image URL in API
- **Bio:** Text field for user description
- **Phone Number:** Contact information
- **Address:** User location details
- **Last Login:** Timestamp of most recent login

**Benefit:** Creates a more realistic and complete user profile system

---

## 5. Audit & Tracking System

### New Tracking Fields

```json
{
  "createdAt": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-02-11T21:45:00Z",
  "lastLogin": "2026-02-11T21:45:00Z",
  "loginCount": 42
}
```

### Implementation Logic

**On User Registration:**

- Set `createdAt` to current timestamp

**On Every Login:**

- Increment `loginCount` by 1
- Update `lastLogin` to current timestamp

**On Profile Update:**

- Update `updatedAt` to current timestamp

**Benefit:** Demonstrates system maturity and proper data tracking

---

## 6. Search & Filter System

### Admin-Only Features

- **User Search**
  - Search by name, email, or ID
  - Real-time search results

- **Filter Options**
  - Filter by role (admin/user)
  - Filter by active status
  - Filter by registration date

- **Sorting**
  - Sort by name (A-Z, Z-A)
  - Sort by registration date (newest/oldest)
  - Sort by last login

- **Pagination**
  - Display 10-20 users per page
  - Navigation controls (prev/next)
  - Page number display

**Benefit:** Demonstrates advanced data handling and UI skills

---

## 7. API Enhancement (JSON Server/MockAPI)

### Simulated Features

- **Query Parameters Filtering**
  - Filter users by role, status, etc.
- **Pagination Support**
  - Limit and offset parameters
- **Sorting**
  - Sort by various fields
- **Mock Error Handling**
  - Simulate 404, 500 errors
  - Test error boundary components
- **Delayed Responses**
  - Simulate network latency
  - Test loading states

---

## 8. UI & UX Professional Upgrade

### Components to Add

- **Skeleton Loaders**
  - Show during data fetching
  - Improve perceived performance

- **Global Loading State**
  - Centralized loading indicator
  - Consistent UX across app

- **Error Boundaries**
  - Catch React errors gracefully
  - Display fallback UI

- **Custom Error Pages**
  - 404 - Page Not Found
  - 403 - Unauthorized Access
  - 500 - Server Error

- **Enhanced Form Feedback**
  - Real-time validation
  - Clear error messages
  - Success confirmations

- **Password Strength Meter**
  - Visual indicator during password creation
  - Requirements checklist

**Benefit:** Separates professional developers from beginners

---

## 9. Multi-Device Session Management

### Features to Implement

- **"Remember Me" Option**
  - Persistent login (30 days)
  - Temporary login (session only)

- **Session Type Handling**
  - Use `localStorage` for persistent sessions
  - Use `sessionStorage` for temporary sessions
