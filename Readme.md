## 📖 Overview

**LookSphere** is a modern social media platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Originally starting as a pure React/JSON-server authentication practice app ("SecureAuth"), it has evolved into a robust, secure, and full-featured social networking application.

It features a dark-theme-first aesthetic, secure JWT authentication, rich media sharing (Cloudinary), and a responsive, dynamic UI built with Tailwind CSS.

## 🗺️ The Journey

LookSphere originally started as **SecureAuth**, a modern authentication app built with pure React.js and a JSON-server API deployed on Render. I built SecureAuth to practice when I first learned React. As I learned new technologies like Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, and various other libraries, I wanted a real-world project to apply everything I was learning.

I decided to upgrade SecureAuth, converting it from a simple JSON-server API into a fully-fledged MERN stack web application. I was really enjoying the process, and I thought, "Why not build something we use every day?" So, I decided to build a social media platform. That led to the creation of LookSphere, and here it is today!

While it is still not a final version and serves primarily as a way to practice full-stack development, this has been the incredible journey from SecureAuth to LookSphere. And rest assured, LookSphere is now even more secure than its predecessor.
