LookSphere is a modern social media platform designed to help you look into your surrounding sphere. It is reliable, consistent, and privacy-first. We believe in protecting your privacy—your data is never shared or leaked. We support both light and dark themes, with a dark-theme-first approach.

The frontend is crafted with React 19 and Vite for a lightning-fast development and production experience. Every screen — from the global feed and user profiles to the contact desk and admin moderation panels — is built with reusable, modular components and styled using Tailwind CSS for a sleek, dark-theme-first aesthetic. Forms are powered by React Hook Form and validated with Yup schemas on the client side before any data touches the network, keeping the experience smooth and secure. Lucide React provides a clean, consistent icon set, while React Toastify and React Spinners handle real-time feedback so users always know what's happening. The result is an interface that feels responsive, polished, and purpose-built for social interaction.

## 🎯 What You Can Do

- **Post & Share:** Express yourself! Upload photos & media, write captions & stories, add alt text for accessibility, reach a global audience, and see real-time post view counts.
- **Explore & Discover:** Never miss a thing. Browse a global post feed, use smart search & filters, discover new creators, and get curated recommendations.

- **Secure Profile:** Keep your data protected. Manage your profile, enjoy JWT stateless sessions, bcrypt password hashing, and profile view tracking.

## 🛡️ Data Integrity & Security

- **Bcrypt (Password Hashing):** All user passwords are hashed with bcrypt using 12 salt rounds before storage. Plain-text passwords are never saved.
- **JSON Web Tokens (Authentication):** Stateless JWT tokens are issued on login and verified on every protected route.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Protection):** Strict CORS policies ensure only trusted origins can communicate with the API.
- **Express Validator (Server-Side Validation):** All incoming request data is validated and sanitized on the server.
- **Yup + React Hook Form (Client-Side Validation):** Schema-based form validation ensures user input is validated before it even reaches the server.
- **Dotenv (Secret Management):** All sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables, never in source code.
